# virtustream-fibonacci

## Problem statement:
Please provide a sample project for review:
1. The project should provide a web service.
   1. It accepts a number, n, as input and returns the first n Fibonacci numbers, starting from 0. i.e. given n = 5, appropriate output would represent the sequence "0 1 1 2 3".
   2. Given a negative number, it will respond with an appropriate error.
2. Include whatever instructions are necessary to build and deploy/run the project, where "deploy/run" means the web service is accepting requests and responding to them as appropriate.
3. Include some tests
While this project is admittedly trivial, approach it as representing a more complex problem that you'll have to put into production and maintain for several years, with production quality code. Providing a link to a github/bitbucket repo with the project would probably be the easiest way to submit.

## Solution:
